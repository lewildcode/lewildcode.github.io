## Finally, we're online!
After some experimenting with setting up a custom blog using [ZF2](http://framework.zend.com/ "Zend Framework 2"), i've decided to use [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll") and [Github pages](http://pages.github.com/) instead,
as it seems to be a proven and simple way to get this running real quick and have all the features we need to provide
you with interesting content.

Stay tuned,
Jan
